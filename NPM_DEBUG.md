## Possible Solutions
1. Ensure that npm is installed correctly: You may need to reinstall npm. To do this, first remove npm by running:

```bash
npm uninstall -g npm
```
Then reinstall npm globally:

```bash
npm install -g npm
```
2. Ensure that npm and Node.js paths are set correctly: Check that your system’s environment variables are pointing to the correct location for npm and Node.js.
    - Right-click on This PC → Properties → Advanced system settings → Environment Variables.
    - Check the PATH variable for entries pointing to Node.js and npm. These paths should include:
      - `C:\Program Files\nodejs\`
      - `C:\Users\<your-username>\AppData\Roaming\npm\`
3. Manually create the missing directory: If the path C:\Users\admin\AppData\Roaming\npm doesn't exist, you can create it manually:

    - Open File Explorer and navigate to `C:\Users\admin\AppData\Roaming\`.
    - Create a new folder named `npm` in this location.
4. Clear the npm cache: Sometimes, the issue can be with cached data. You can try clearing npm’s cache with the following command:

```bash
npm cache clean --force
```
5. Update npm: Make sure you are using the latest version of npm:

```bash
npm install -g npm@latest
```
